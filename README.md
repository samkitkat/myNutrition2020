# myNutrition2020

## Inspiration
- Diet and nutrition apps are one of the most popular and widely used apps in the App Store
- However, many apps focus more on a calorie counting and dieting as your primary way to stay healthy, rather than considering the specific nutritional content of the foods a person will eat.
- Which is why we decided to come up with **myNutrition** a food diary app where you can keep track of your meals in a supportive and healthy way

## What it does
Our app is a tool that looks at the ingredients of your meal and then lets you know the nutritional value of it in an educational manner.

For example, let's say you had a salad for lunch. You enter in that meal in the app and it would analyze the nutritional content of all the meals and snacks you have had for that day. Later you can see from which food groups you have eaten from today and which food groups you haven't eaten from yet.

> Great job getting those veggies in! Let's work on getting some more protein in before the day ends!

## How we built it
We used Figma to design the app and then we created it using Xcode and SwiftUI

## Challenges we ran into
One of our largest challenges was using an API and trying to tie to together with our own code. The API in question does most of the nutritional computation for us and we spent many hours trying to get it to work.
